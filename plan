Data/Plan for GG:

Very simple "clerk world" ... 3 people that could be helped, 3 forms to stamp. Stamp, ask, aid. A2C solves this readily. How does this model behave when a 3rd party audit
model is added to assess normativity?

Description + Pronoun + Action
DPA is analyzed by normative classifier, integrated with the A2C model in various ways

#a2c chooses an action, bert scores the choice a) if its positive add positive, b) if its negative add negative c) add both
#gg-ps multiplies the logits from the gg model with the probabilities for each admissible action

0 -> 1 for A2C probability multiplied by 1 -> -1 for GG logits
-Sensitivity to scaling that influence (1.0, 0.5, 0.1)

Sum of BERT logits across all moves added to loss function

-Approaches
-Max score
-Ranges across all runs (5 per colossal adventure)
-Pronouns
-Alter the words used for aiding
-Experiment descriptor -> Action templates on Qualtrics

-Compare to a cluttered version
-Run on all Jericho games
-Solution length
